# rest-client
Produces Bing search results on command line using Rest Client and regex
Simply type ruby play.rb.
They type the word(s) you want to search.
Incredibly it works with special characters - that's down to rest client escaping them into HTTP format - not me!
I've used regular expressions to pull out the search results and links, if it breaks (because Bing change something) let me know and I will fix.
